##Create a GitHub account and set up your profile


To contribute to the Azure technical content, you'll need a GitHub account.

If you are a Microsoft contributor, you need to set up your GitHub account so you're clearly identified as a Microsoft employee. Set up your profile as follows:
- Profile picture: a picture of you (required)
- Name: your first and last name (required)
- Email: your Microsoft email address (optional)
- Company: Microsoft Corporation (required)
- Location: list your location (optional)

##Sign up for Disqus

Every published technical article has a comment stream provided by the Disqus service.

If you are a Microsoft employee, and if you are the author of or a contributor to an article, you need to sign up for Disqus so you can participate in the comment stream for the article.

1. Sign up for an account at http://www.disqus.com/
2. Fill out your profile as follows:
3. Full Name: your full name as displayed in your Microsoft address book listing, plus the bracketed info, which is your alias plus @MSFT. Format: First Last [alias@MSFT]
4. Location: Your location

##Submit a text-only change to an existing article

If you only need or want to make textual updates to an existing article, you probably don't need to follow the rest of the steps. You can use GitHub's web-based markdown editor to submit your changes. Just click the GitHub link in the article you want to modify:

![] (./img/contributetogit.png)

Then, click the edit icon in the GitHub version of the article

![] (./img/editicon.png)

That opens the easy-to-use web editor that makes it easy to submit changes. You don't need to follow the other steps in this article.

##All other changes

The GitHub UI does support creation of new files and dragging and dropping images. However, when you work in the UI, managing branches can be confusing so we typically recommend you install the tools and learn the commands for creating and managing articles. If you want to use the UI, see:

- [Creating files on Github](https://github.com/blog/1327-creating-files-on-github)
- [Upload files to your repositories](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories)


For the following sorts of work, we strongly recommend you install and learn to use the tools:
- Making major changes to an article
- Creating and publishing a new article
- Adding new images or updating images
- Updating an article over a period of days without publishing changes each of those days
- Creating content for a release that has to go out on a certain day at a certain time
